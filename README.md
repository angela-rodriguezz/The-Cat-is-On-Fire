A 2D sorting pixel game in which I worked with a team to build the code for the main menu and time mechanic of the game in C# using Unity. In a team of 3, my group and I were to complete a game in a week about a mechanic that we found interesting. However, it needed to relate to one of the themes of **_sweat_, _arrange_, and _detection_**. Our team focused on the arrange theme using conveyor belts.
